# ConwaysGameJava
Conway's Game of Life implemented in Java. Once open, choose a seed type and press start. The simulation can be paused/stopped, allowing you to pick another population seed, if desired. To change the likelihood a cell will start alive, change the variable "livingLikelihood" to be a value between 0 and 1 inclusively.
